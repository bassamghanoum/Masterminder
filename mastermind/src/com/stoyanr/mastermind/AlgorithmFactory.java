/**
 * Interface to be implemented by all algorithm factory implementations. This interface has a single
 * method which returns a newly created algorithm of the correct type.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Algorithm factories are intended to be used whenever a large number of games should be played
 * with the same algorithm, for example when evaluating the effectiveness of the different
 * strategies. A single {@link Algorithm} instance can't be reused for multiple games, as algorithms
 * are mutable, that is playing a single game changes their state in a way that makes them
 * unsuitable for playing a second one.

 * This is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern">Abstract Factory</a>
 * design pattern in action.
