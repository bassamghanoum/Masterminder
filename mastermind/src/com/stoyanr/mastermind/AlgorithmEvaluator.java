/**
 * An evaluator of the effectiveness of the different strategies. It is initialized with a
 * {@link Mastermind} instance (game setup), and an {@link AlgorithmFactory}. To perform an
 * evaluation, call the {@link #evaluate()} method of the evaluator. The remaining methods of this
 * class should be invoked only after the evaluation is complete to determine the various statistics
 * produced by the evaluation, among them the average rounds played which is the main characteristic
 * used to measure the strategy effectiveness. An evaluation can be performed only once.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Performing an evaluation requires playing all possible games for a given game setup. This is
 * computationally hard and can take a lot of time, especially for larger alphabets and combination
 * lengths. To alleviate this issue, an instance of the {@link GuessCalculator} class is created
 * upon construction and used during the evaluation.
