**Mastermind** is a Java implementation of several strategies for winning the popular board game [Mastermind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game). It also includes a simple command line interface for playing the game, as well as built-in evaluation for the effectiveness of the different strategies.

I created Mastermind more than one year ago, in February - March 2011. It was for a few months my personal playground for learning, experimenting, and adopting agile software engineering practices and tools, such as:
* [Test Driven Development (TDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) with [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/).
* Comprehensive static checks with [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/), [Checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/), and [PMD](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/).
* Code coverage with [Emma](http://emma.sourceforge.net/) and its Eclipse counterpart [Eclemma](http://www.eclemma.org/).
* Acceptance testing with [FitNesse](http://fitnesse.org/).
* Putting everything together in an automated [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) build.
